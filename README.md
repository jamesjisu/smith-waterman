# smith-waterman
An implementation of the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm in Python

## Introduction
The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a dynamic programming approach to the sequence/string alignment problem: succintly, given two strings, how can we align matching regions of the two strings to have the greatest similarity between the two? The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm) about the Smith-Waterman algorithm provides an excellent explanation of the algorithm
